Cut a section of a line by byte using -b option
Eg. cut -b 2 would get 2nd byte

To separate by characters (that may be separated with commas) use -c
Characters can sometimes be more that 1 byte, so safer to use -c option

-d is delimiter option , usually used with field (-f) option to specify that field should be cut

The options refer to what you want to be shown, ie the items that are cut, will be shown.

Cut -d ',' -f 1 names.csv
Would show the first field in each line of names.csv
The fields have been explained as having "," between each.

Multiple fields to be cut can be specified eg. 1,4 would give the first and fourth field

The --complement option shows the inverse
Eg cut --complement -c 1 would show all but the first character

Output delimiters convert defined characters
Cut -d ';' -f 1,3,4 --output-de

Cuts the fields 1 3 and 4, and swaps the ';' to a spaced returns output 

Sort
-t, -k4 will sort items alphabetically t showing where it starts and k saying where it ends (field 4)
