q. Webpage volume (how are these different to directory as a place where you want things to be saved??
Volumes are managed by docker
Easier to manage, you can share multiple files etc.

Bind mounts
Most basic way of sharing files between container and host machine
The two flags you need are the -v and --mount flags, differing on which you prefer and what functionality you need.

-v or --volume
Takes 3 fields, separated by colons.
EG. docker run -d -p 80:80 --volume $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro nginx


Field 1 : provide file or directory on the host, full path. You can use function commands like $(pwd) here. If file doesn't exist, docker will create it and give it only root access.

Field 2: Where the file will be mounted in the container. You can replace files with this file.

Field 3: Options that can be added to the file/directory that is in the container eg. ro read only access to file or rw read and write access.
These modifiers (-v or --volume only) will modify distributions that work with SELinux(security enhanced linux). 'z' indicates the file/dir will be accessed by more than 1 container, 'Z' indicates that just 1 container will have access.


Volumes
When making a volume you have to specify name and where it will be mounted in container.
Eg docker run --volume my-volume:/usr/share/nginx/html

The mount flag ,do the same but with source and commas.
docker run --mount source=my-volume,destination=/usr/share/nginx/html

For Jenkins exercise using volume
docker volume create jenkins-test
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins --volume jenkinstest:/var/jenkins_home jenkins
Docker exec -it Jenkins bash
>>> cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
set up on ip:8080
Then create job
You can stop + delete image + container and when running command docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins --volume jenkinstest:/var/jenkins_home jenkins you'll still have build job details because it has been stored in volume!




Difference between tcp and ucp??

Docker compose
Using one configuration file you can define and run multiple docker containers 
Minimal effort
You need jq and curl installed https://get.docker.com etc |sudo bash
